abstract: "Just mix to get six: Six contiguous stereocenters, including one
  quaternary stereocenter, and three C-C bonds are created by a new
  copper-catalyzed tandem reaction (see scheme). Rigid chiral diamine ligands
  enabled this asymmetric tandem reaction to proceed with excellent
  stereoselectivity (complete diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity)
  and high yield under mild reaction conditions."

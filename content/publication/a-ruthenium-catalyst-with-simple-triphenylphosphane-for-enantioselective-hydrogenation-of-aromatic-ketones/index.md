abstract: An efficient Ru catalyst constructed from simple and commercially
  available triphenylphosphane and enantiopure (1S,1'S)-1,1-biisoindoline (BIDN)
  was applied to the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic ketones. A range of
  simple aromatic ketones could be hydrogenated with good to excellent
  enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee). An appropriate enantioselective
  transition state was proposed to explain the high enantioselectivity obtained
  with this catalytic system. This study represents the first example to
  establish a practical Noyori-type catalyst with a simple achiral monophosphane
  for highly enantioselective hydrogenation.

abstract: A practical and efficient synthetic method for synthesis of benzylic
  tertiary amines by using arylboronic acids, paraformaldehyde and secondary
  amines was established in the absence of catalyst. This reaction is very
  simple and can be efficiently performed under mild conditions, which
  establishes a practical approach toward a wide range of benzylic tertiary
  amines.

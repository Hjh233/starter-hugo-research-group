abstract: A novel and efficient Rh/O2 catalytic system has been developed and
  shown to catalyze highly efficient oxidative Câ€“H activation/annulation
  reactions, producing a broad range of isoquinolinium salts with high turnover
  numbers (up to 740). Mechanistic studies provided strong evidence of facile
  oxidation of Rh(I) to Rh(III) by molecular oxygen facilitated by acid.

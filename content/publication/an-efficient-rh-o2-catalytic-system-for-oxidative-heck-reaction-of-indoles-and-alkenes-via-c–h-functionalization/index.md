abstract: A rhodium(III)-catalyzed direct selective C-2 alkenylation reaction of
  indoles with alkenes has been developed with molecular oxygen as the sole
  oxidant. The rhodium/oxygen catalytic system is applicable to a broad range of
  indoles and alkenes, which provides a novel access to various C-2 alkenylated
  indoles and pyrroles.

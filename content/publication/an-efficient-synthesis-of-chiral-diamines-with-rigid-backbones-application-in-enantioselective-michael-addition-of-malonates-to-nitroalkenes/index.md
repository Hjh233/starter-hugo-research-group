abstract: A new and efficient route for synthesis of enantiomerically pure
  biisoindoline and its isomer based on the diaza-Cope rearrangement reaction
  with chiral 1,2-bis(2-hydroxylphenyl)-1,2-diaminoethane as starting material
  has been developed. The newly prepared biisoindoline was employed as a chiral
  ligand in the Ni(II)-catalyzed enantioselective Michael addition of malonates
  to conjugated nitroalkenes, and good to excellent enantioselectivities were
  obtained.

abstract: The asymmetric construction of allylic C–O bonds with primary or
  secondary aliphatic alcohols remains a substantial challenge in Pd-catalyzed
  allylation chemistry. Here, we report the development of an additive-free,
  palladium-catalyzed asymmetric aminomethylative etherification of conjugated
  dienes that enables the efficient, asymmetric O-allylation of primary and
  secondary aliphatic alcohols as well as water. Mechanism studies revealed that
  the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the alcohol and the in situ
  introduced aminomethyl moiety is critical to facilitate the nucleophilic
  addition of the alcohol to the π-allylpalladium species, which opened up the
  possibility of using aliphatic alcohols and water as nucleophilic substrates.
  This reaction tolerates a broad range of functional groups and shows
  remarkable regioselectivities and uniformly high enantioselectivities, which
  provides a direct and rapid approach to optically pure allylic 1,3-amino
  ethers and 1,3-amino alcohols from simple starting materials.

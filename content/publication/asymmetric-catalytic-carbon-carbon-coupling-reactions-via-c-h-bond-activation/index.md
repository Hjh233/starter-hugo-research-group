abstract: Asymmetric catalytic C–C coupling reactions via C–H bond activation
  are currently among the most attractive and powerful tools in synthetic
  organic chemistry. In the past few decades, a variety of catalytic asymmetric
  C–C coupling reactions via C–H bond activation have been reported. Compared
  with traditional asymmetric C–C bond formation reactions, C–H activation/C–C
  coupling strategies have more advantages in terms of power and
  cost-effectiveness. In this review, after a short introduction of C–H
  activation/C–C coupling reactions, recent studies on C–H activation/C–C
  coupling reactions are reviewed, with an emphasis on enantioselective
  cross-dehydrogenative-coupling, C–H activation/olefin coupling reactions,
  hydroacylation of aldehydes via C–H activation, as well as C–H
  activation/R–X(M) coupling reactions.

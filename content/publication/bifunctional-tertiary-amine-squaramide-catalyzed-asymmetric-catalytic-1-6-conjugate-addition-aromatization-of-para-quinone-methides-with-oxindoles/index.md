abstract: The asymmetric catalytic 1,6-addition of p-QMs with racemic oxindoles
  under the bifunctional catalysis of C2-symmetric dimeric Cinchona-derived
  squaramide is described. This tertiary amine-squaramide catalyzed reaction
  provides a diastereoselective and enantioselective approach to the effective
  assembly of diverse diarylmethine-substituted oxindoles having vicinal
  tertiary and quaternary stereocenters.

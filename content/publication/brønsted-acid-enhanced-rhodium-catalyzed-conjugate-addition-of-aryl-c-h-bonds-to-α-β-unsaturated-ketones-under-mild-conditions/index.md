abstract: "Acid test: With a Brønsted acid as the solvent, the rhodium-catalyzed
  direct addition of aryl C-H bonds to α,β-unsaturated ketones was realized
  under mild reaction conditions (see scheme). The acid may assist by
  interceding in the conflict of the two proton-transfer events and averting the
  substrate inhibition involved in this type of C-H addition reaction."

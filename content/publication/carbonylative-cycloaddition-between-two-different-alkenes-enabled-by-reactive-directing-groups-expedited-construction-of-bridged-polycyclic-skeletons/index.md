abstract: A novel palladium-catalyzed highly selective hydrocarbonylative
  cycloaddition reaction with two different alkenes in the presence of CO
  enabled by a reactive directing-group is developed, which offers efficient and
  convenient access to lactone-containing bridged polycyclic compounds in high
  yield with high chemo- and stereoselectivities.

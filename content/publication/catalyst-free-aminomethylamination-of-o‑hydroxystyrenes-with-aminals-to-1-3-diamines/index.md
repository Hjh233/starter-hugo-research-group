abstract: A new catalyst-free protocol for aminomethylamination of
  o-hydroxystyrenes with simple aminals is described. This direct and
  operationally simple method provides a fundamentally novel and rapid approach
  for the synthesis of 1,3-diamines. This novel reaction occurs under mild
  reaction conditions and provides a fundamentally unique and efficient strategy
  for the synthesis of 1,3-diamines with good to excellent yields.

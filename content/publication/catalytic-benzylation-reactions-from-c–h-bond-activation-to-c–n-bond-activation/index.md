abstract: Transition-metal mediated activation of inert chemical bonds is an
  ongoing topic in homogeneous catalysis. In view of the abundance and
  accessibility of alkylarenes and benzylamines, the use of them as benzyl
  source in catalytic benzylation reactions via benzylic C—H and C—N bond
  activation is highly desirable. Indeed, compared with the traditional
  approaches with benzyl halide as the substrates, benzylation reactions via C—H
  and C—N bond cleavage provide more efficient, atom-economic strategies to
  access myriads of synthetically important molecules. In this account, our
  group's efforts on catalytic benzylation reactions via directed C—H
  activation, nondirected C—H activation and C—N bond activation are summarized.

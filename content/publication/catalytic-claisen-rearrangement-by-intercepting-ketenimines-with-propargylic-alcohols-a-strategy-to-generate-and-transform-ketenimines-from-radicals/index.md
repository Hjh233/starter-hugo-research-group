abstract: An efficient strategy for facilitating the cross-coupling of two
  radicals has been established via the coordination of a radical with a metal
  catalyst. This strategy provides a remarkable ability to harness the
  reactivity of nitrile-containing azoalkanes and enables a novel cascade
  reaction with nitrile-containing azoalkanes and propargylic alcohols to be
  established. By using this reaction, a range of acetylenic and allenic amides
  were obtained that provides a versatile platform for further derivatizations.

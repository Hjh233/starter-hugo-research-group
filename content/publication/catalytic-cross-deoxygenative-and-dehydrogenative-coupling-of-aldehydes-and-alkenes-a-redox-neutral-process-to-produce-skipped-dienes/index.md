abstract: A novel catalytic cross deoxygenative and dehydrogenative coupling
  reaction of aldehydes and alkenes was established via a cooperative catalysis
  approach. This transformation provided an efficient and atom-economic protocol
  for the synthesis of 1,4-skipped dienes from aldehydes and simple alkenes
  under oxidant-free reaction conditions.

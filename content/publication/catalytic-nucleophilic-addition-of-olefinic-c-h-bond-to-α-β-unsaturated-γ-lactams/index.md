abstract: A novel catalytic nucleophilic addition of olefins to
  α,β-unsaturated-γ-lactams has been developed with a cyclic N-acyliminium ion
  as a key intermediate. It provides an efficient approach to
  5-alkenyl-2-pyrrolidinones from simple and readily available starting
  materials and the desired products could be obtained in moderate to good
  yields (23–85%).

abstract: A novel catalytic reaction has been developed for the nucleophilic
  addition of terminal alkynes to α,β-unsaturated-γ-lactams via a cyclic
  N-acyliminium ion intermediate. This simple reaction proceeds under mild
  conditions, and represents a practical approach for the construction of a wide
  range of 5-alkynyl-2-pyrrolidinones in moderate to good yields (45%–76%).

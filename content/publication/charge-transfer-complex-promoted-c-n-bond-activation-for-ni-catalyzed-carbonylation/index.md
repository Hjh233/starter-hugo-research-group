  A new strategy was developed for activation of C–N bond via formation of an
  amine–I2 charge-transfer complex, which facilitates the inert C–N bond
  activation via oxidative addition with Ni(0). This strategy has been
  successfully applied in the Ni-catalyzed carbonylation of benzylamines via
  direct insertion of CO into the C–N bond, which provided a straightforward and
  rapid approach to arylacetamides in the presence of catalytic amounts of I2
  and Ni catalyst. Mechanistic studies suggested that a benzyl radical generated
  via the oxidative addition was involved in the present reaction.

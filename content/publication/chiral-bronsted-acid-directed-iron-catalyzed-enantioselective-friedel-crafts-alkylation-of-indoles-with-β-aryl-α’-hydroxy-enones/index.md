abstract: A cooperative catalytic system established by the combination of an
  iron salt and a chiral Brønsted acid has proven to be effective in the
  asymmetric Friedel–Crafts alkylation of indoles with β-aryl α′-hydroxy enones.
  Good to excellent yields and enatioselectivities were observed for a variety
  of α′-hydroxy enones and indoles, particularly for the β-aryl α′-hydroxy
  enones bearing an electron-withdrawing group at the para position of the
  phenyl ring (up to 90 % yield and 91 % ee). The proton of the chiral Brønsted
  acid, the Lewis acid activation site, as well as the inherent basic site for
  the hydrogen-bonding interaction of the Brønsted acid are responsible for the
  high catalytic activities and enantioselectivities of the title reaction. A
  possible reaction mechanism was proposed. The key catalytic species in the
  catalytic system, the phosphate salt of FeIII, which was thought to be
  responsible for the high activity and good enantioselectivity, was then
  confirmed by ESIMS studies.

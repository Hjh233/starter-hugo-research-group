abstract: Chiral phosphoric acid was found to be an effective organocatalyst in
  the enantioselective aza-Michael addition of aromatic amines to nitroolefins
  giving the corresponding Î²-nitroamine products in good yields (65%-95%) with
  moderate to good enantiomeric excess (16%-70%). This study represents the
  first example of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed asymmetric aza-Michael
  addition reaction.

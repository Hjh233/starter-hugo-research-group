abstract: A novel enantioselective [4 + 2] annulation of the allenoates having a
  unique positive ortho-effect with in situ generated ortho-quinone methides has
  been developed under the catalysis of Cinchona alkaloid. This chiral
  amine-catalyzed reaction provides an alternative route to asymmetric catalytic
  construction of synthetically interesting, highly functionalized chiral
  chromans in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee).

abstract: A conceptually new cooperative catalytic system via a synergistic
  combination of aldehyde and copper catalysis has been established based on
  systemic mechanistic studies. This new cooperative catalysis has been
  successfully applied in the direct aerobic oxidative CH amination of azoles
  at room temperature, which was previously realized under harsh conditions.
  Mechanistic studies including isotopic labeling experiments and kinetic
  isotope effect (KIE) experiments support a reaction pathway that involves
  formation of an aminal, hydrolysis of the aminal to generate the copper-amide
  species, subsequent CH amination and re-oxidation of copper(I) to copper(II)
  by oxygen. It not only provides an efficient method to realize the oxidative
  CH amination of benzoxazoles with free amines at room temperature, but also
  paves the way for establishing new CN bond formation reactions by using this
  efficient cooperative catalysis.

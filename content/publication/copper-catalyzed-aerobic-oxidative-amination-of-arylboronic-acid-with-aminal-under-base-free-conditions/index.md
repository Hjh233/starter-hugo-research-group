abstract: A new process involving copper-catalyzed oxidative amination reaction
  of various arylboronic acids with aminals under mild conditions has been
  developed. The key copper-amide species involved in the C-N bond-forming
  process was generated via C-N bond cleavage of aminal under base-free
  conditions. Moderate yields of desired amination products can be obtained
  under mild conditions when air was served as oxidant and PhCO2H was used as an
  additive.

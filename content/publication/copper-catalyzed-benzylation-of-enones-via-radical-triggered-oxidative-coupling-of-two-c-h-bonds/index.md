abstract: A novel copper(II)-catalyzed, regioselective C–H benzylation of enones
  with toluenes via radical triggered oxidative coupling has been developed. A
  series of enones and toluenes with different substituents were successfully
  incorporated, providing a wide range of α-benzylated enones with TBP as
  oxidant by cleavage of C(sp3)–H bond and C(sp2)–H bond. Preliminary
  mechanistic study reveals a benzylic carbon radical is generated, and
  regioselectively reacts with enones to deliver the corresponding products.

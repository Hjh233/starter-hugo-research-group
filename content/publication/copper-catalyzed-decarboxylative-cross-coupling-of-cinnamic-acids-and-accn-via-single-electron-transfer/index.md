abstract: A novel and convenient method for the synthesis of β,γ-unsaturated
  nitriles using ACCN (1,1'-azobis(cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile)) as a cyano
  source was described. This reaction was amenable to a broad range of
  substrates and provided the desired β,γ-unsaturated nitriles containing an
  all-carbon quaternary carbon center in moderate yields with high selectivity
  via single electron transfer and decarboxylation.

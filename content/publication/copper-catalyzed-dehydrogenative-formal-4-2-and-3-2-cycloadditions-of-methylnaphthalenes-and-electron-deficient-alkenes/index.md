  Higher pi-extended naphthalene, contained in methylnaphthalenes, which could
  capture alkyl radicals via SOMO-LUMO interactions, enabled the development of
  Cu-catalyzed formal [4 + 2] and [3 + 2] cycloadditions between
  methylnaphthalenes and electron-deficient alkenes. Under copper catalysis, a
  series of electron-deficient alkenes and methylnaphthalenes with different
  substituents were successfully incorporated with di-tert-butyl peroxide (TBP)
  as an oxidant and radical initiator, providing a wide range of cycloadducts.

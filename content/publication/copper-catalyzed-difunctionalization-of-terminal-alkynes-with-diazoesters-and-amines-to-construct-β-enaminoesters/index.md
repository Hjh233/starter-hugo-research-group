abstract: An operationally simple and efficient copper‐catalyzed three‐component
  tandem reaction of terminal alkynes, diazo compounds and amines to yield
  β‐enamino esters is described. This straightforward protocol takes place
  rapidly with a wide range of substrates and gives the desired β‐enamino esters
  in good to excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that
  the reaction probably proceeds through Cu‐catalyzed formal C–H insertion to
  produce an alkynoate intermediate, which was then trapped by amines to give
  the β‐enamino esters.

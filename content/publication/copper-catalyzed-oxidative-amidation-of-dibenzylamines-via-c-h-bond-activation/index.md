abstract: A new method has been developed for the oxidative amidation of
  dibenzylamines to construct N-benzylbenzamides via C-H bond activation. This
  new method allows for the formation of two amide products from a single
  dibenzylamine starting material in good yields using CuBr as a catalyst and
  diacetoxyiodobenzene as an oxidant under mild reaction conditions. The
  catalyst system performed efficiently, and this study represents the first
  reported use of diacetoxyiodobenzene as an oxidant for the oxidative amidation
  of dibenzylamines to the corresponding N-benzylbenzamides. (C) 2013, Dalian

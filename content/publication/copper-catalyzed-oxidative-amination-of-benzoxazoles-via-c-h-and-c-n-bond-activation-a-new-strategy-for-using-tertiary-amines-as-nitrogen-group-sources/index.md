abstract: An efficient and conceptually new method for oxidative amination of
  azoles with tertiary amines via copper-catalyzed C−H and C−N bond activation
  has been developed. This protocol can be performed in the absence of external
  base and only requires atmospheric oxygen as oxidant. The catalyst system is
  very simple and efficient, which opens a new way for using tertiary amines as
  nitrogen group sources for C−N bond formation reactions.

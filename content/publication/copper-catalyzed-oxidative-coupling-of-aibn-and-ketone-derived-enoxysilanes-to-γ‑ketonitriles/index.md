abstract: A new and efficient oxidative coupling reaction between enoxysilane
  and alkylnitrile radicals derived from readily available AIBN and its
  analogues has been developed by using redox-active metal as a catalyst in
  which the redox-active copper is used for enhancing the electrophilicity of a
  free radical via coordination and bringing the radical and nucleophilic enol
  ether closer to facilitate the single-electron transfer. The present catalytic
  protocol afforded a variety of γ-ketonitriles in good to excellent yields with
  good functional group tolerance.

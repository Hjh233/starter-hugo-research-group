abstract: An efficient Cu-catalyzed C–H amination of 2-alkylazaarenes with
  azodicarboxylates has been developed through nucleophilic addition of sp3C–H
  bond to unsaturated nitrogen–nitrogen double bond. It provides an easy access
  to azaarene-containing hydrazines from simple and easily available starting
  materials.

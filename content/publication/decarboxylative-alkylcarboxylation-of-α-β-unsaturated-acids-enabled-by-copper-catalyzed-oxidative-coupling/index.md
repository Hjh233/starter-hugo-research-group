abstract: A facile and general method for copper-catalyzed decarboxylative
  alkylcarboxylation of cinnamic acids with dimethyl
  2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionate) has been developed. The scope and versatility
  of the reaction was demonstrated, and a broad range of substrates bearing
  electron-donating and -withdrawing groups on the aromatic rings were all
  compatible with this reaction to provide desired β,γ-unsaturated esters in
  moderate to good yields. Moreover, α,β-unsaturated acids with a carbonyl group
  on the γ-position of acrylic acids also smoothly proceeded to furnish the
  desired products in good yields.

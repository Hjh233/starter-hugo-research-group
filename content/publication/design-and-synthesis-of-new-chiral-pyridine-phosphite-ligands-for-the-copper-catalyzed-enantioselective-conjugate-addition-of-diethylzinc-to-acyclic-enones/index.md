abstract: A series of new chiral pyridineâ€“phosphite ligands have been prepared
  from (R)-pyridyl alcohols and BINOL-derived chlorophosphite, and successfully
  employed in the copper-catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of
  diethylzinc to acyclic enones. Using the simple and inexpensive CuBr2 as a
  precursor, the enantioselective additions to various substituted acyclic
  enones afforded products in high yields and good enantioselectivities (up to
  92% ee).

abstract: A series of efficient catalytic systems has been developed to control
  the dual enantioselectivity of the conjugate addition of α-keto esters to
  nitroalkenes. The use of the chiral diamine (1S,1’S)-1,1′-biisoindoline as a
  chiral ligand with either (Cu(OAc)2·H2O or Ni(OAc)2·4H2O as the catalyst
  provide facile access to the respective enantiomers resulting from the
  conjugate addition reaction with high levels of enantioselectivity (94% ee vs
  93% ee). Furthermore, the use of Cu(OAc)2·H2O as the metal center allowed the
  enantioselectivity of the conjugate addition reaction to be switched through
  the tuning of the rigidity of the chiral diamine ligand (94% ee vs 94% ee).

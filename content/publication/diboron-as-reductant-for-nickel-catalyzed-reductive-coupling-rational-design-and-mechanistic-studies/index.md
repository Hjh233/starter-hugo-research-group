abstract: Diboron (B2pin2) has been identified as an efficient and
  environmentally benign reducing reagent for reductive coupling reactions for
  the first time, which enables the nickel-catalyzed reductive tetramerization
  of alkynes to be performed with high efficiency. Mechanistic and kinetic
  studies indicate that the facile reductive elimination to form the B–B bond
  from the dinuclear Ni–Ni complexes is responsible for the high efficiency. The
  activation enthalpy (ΔH‡ = 56.5 kJ mol−1), entropy (ΔS‡ = −128 J mol−1 K−1)
  and the substituent effect (ρ = 1.43) on this reaction were obtained.

abstract: A novel highly enantioselective aminomethylamination of conjugated
  dienes with aminals catalyzed by a chiral palladium complex ligated with
  BINOL-derived chiral diphosphinite has been successfully developed. This
  reaction proceeds via a Pd-catalyzed cascade C-N bond activation,
  aminomethylation, and asymmetric allylic amination reaction under mild
  reaction conditions, providing a unique and efficient strategy for the
  synthesis of enantiomerically pure allylic 1,3-diamines.

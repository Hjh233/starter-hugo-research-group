abstract: A series of tetradentate sp2N/sp3N hybrid chiral N4 ligands derived
  from rigid chiral diamines were synthesized, which enabled the first
  manganese-catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation of electron-deficient alkenes
  with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant. The reaction furnishes
  enantiomerically pure epoxy amides, epoxy ketones as well as epoxy esters in
  good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.9% ee) with lower
  catalyst loading. Preliminary studies on structureâ€“activity relationship
  demonstrated that maintaining comparatively lower electron-donating ability of
  the sp3N and relatively higher electron-donating ability of sp2N of the N4
  ligands is beneficial to getting higher activity and selectivity, thus
  providing us a new view to understand epoxidation with H2O2.

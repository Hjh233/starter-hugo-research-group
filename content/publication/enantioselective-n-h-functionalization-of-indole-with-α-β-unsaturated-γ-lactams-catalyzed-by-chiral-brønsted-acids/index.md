abstract: "Nitrogen revives: Cyclic N-acyliminium ions were generated from
  α,β-unsaturated γ-lactams (1) and underwent intermolecular addition by indole
  nucleophiles (2) under the catalysis of a chiral Brønsted acid (3). A variety
  of N-functionalized indole derivatives containing a pyrrolidinone moiety (4)
  were assembled with high enantioselectivity. Bn=benzyl."

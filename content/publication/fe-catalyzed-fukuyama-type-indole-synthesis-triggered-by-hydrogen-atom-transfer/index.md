abstract: Fe, Co, and Mn hydride-initiated radical olefin additions have enjoyed
  great success in modern synthesis, yet the extension of other hydrogen
  radicalophiles instead of olefins remains largely elusive. Herein, we report
  an efficient Fe-catalyzed intramolecular isonitrileâ€“olefin coupling reaction
  delivering 3-substituted indoles, in which isonitrile was firstly applied as
  the hydrogen atom acceptor in the radical generation step by MHAT. The
  protocol features low catalyst loading, mild reaction conditions, and
  excellent functional group tolerance.

abstract: An efficient asymmetric tandem dual Michael reaction that constructs
  three contiguous stereocenters in acyclic open-chain systems with very high
  enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity has been developed. This protocol
  provides a reliable and rapid approach for synthesis of chiral pyrrolidines
  with multiple stereocenters.

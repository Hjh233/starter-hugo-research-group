abstract: An asymmetric hydrogenation of sterically hindered β,β-disubstituted
  enones has been well-established by using a ruthenium complex composed of an
  achiral diphosphane and a chiral diamine as catalyst, wherein the carbonyl
  group was selectively hydrogenated to give a wide range of chiral allylic
  alcohols with high levels of enantioselectivity and complete chemoselectivity.

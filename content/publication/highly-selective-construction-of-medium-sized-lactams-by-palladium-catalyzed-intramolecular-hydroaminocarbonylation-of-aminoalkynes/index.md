  A novel palladium-catalyzed intramolecular hydro-aminocarbonylation of
  aminoalkynes has been developed. This direct and operationally simple protocol
  provides a rapid and reliable approach to a diverse array of valuable seven-
  and eight-membered lactams with high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity.
  The high selectivity might be attributed to rational tuning the electronic
  nature of the amine moiety and the palladium catalyst, which enabled this
  transformation to proceed in the absence of acidic or any other additives
  under fairly mild reaction conditions. This method paves the way for the
  synthesis of medium-sized lactams.

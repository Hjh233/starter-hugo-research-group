abstract: A convenient and efficient iron-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of
  simple alkenes to isochroman acetals has been established for the synthesis of
  1-alkenyl isochromans. In the presence of 5–20 mol % iron(III)
  p-toluenesulfonate, the alkenyl functionalized isochromans were prepared in
  moderate to excellent yields. This transformation provides a novel methodology
  for the synthesis of 1-alkenyl isochromans from simple alkenes and isochroman
  acetals.

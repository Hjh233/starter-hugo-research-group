abstract: A novel iron-catalyzed alkenylation of 2-substituted azaarenes through
  sp3 C–H bond activation has been developed. A favorable E2-elimination is
  proposed as a key step to cleavage of C–H and C–N bonds for the construction
  of a C═C bond in high stereoselectivity. This transformation represents an
  efficient way to synthesize 2-alkenylated azaarenes from simple starting
  materials.

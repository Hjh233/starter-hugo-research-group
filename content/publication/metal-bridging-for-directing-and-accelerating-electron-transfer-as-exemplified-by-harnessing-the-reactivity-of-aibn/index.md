abstract: A new strategy for tuning the electron transfer between radicals and
  enolates has been developed. This method elicits the innate reactivity of AIBN
  with a copper catalyst and enables a cascade reaction with cinnamic acids.
  Electron paramagnetic resonance studies and control experiments indicate that
  the redox-active copper species not only activates the radical by
  coordination, but also serves as a bridge to bring the radical and nucleophile
  within close proximity to facilitate electron transfer. By exploiting possible
  combinations of redox-active metals and radical entities with suitable
  coordinating functional groups, this strategy should contribute to the
  development of a broad range of radical-based reactions.

abstract: A novel and catalyst‐free multicomponent reaction with cyclic tertiary
  amines, electron‐deficient aryl halides or heteroaromatic halides, and Na2S
  enabled by facile C−N bond cleavage of the cyclic tertiary amines was
  developed. This direct and operationally simple method can be applied with a
  wide range of functional groups and provides an efficient and rapid approach
  to potentially drug‐like products containing amine, azaarene, thioether, or
  phenol ether functionalities in good to excellent yields. The utility of this
  method was demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of the analgesic ruzadolane.

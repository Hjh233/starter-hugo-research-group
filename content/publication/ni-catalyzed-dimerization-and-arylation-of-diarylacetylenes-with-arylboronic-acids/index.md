  A new, facile, and efficient protocol for the synthesis of polysubstituted
  conjugated 1,3-dienes through Ni-catalyzed tandem dimerization/cross-coupling
  reaction of diarylacetylenes and arylboronic acids in the presence of a
  catalytic amount of B(2)pin(2) has been developed. A series of arynes and
  arylboronic acids with different substituents participated well in this
  catalytic system, affording a variety of useful conjugated 1,3-dienes.

abstract: A nickel-catalyzed alkylarylation of active alkenes with tertiary
  benzylamines was achieved by charge-transfer-complex promoted C−N bond
  activation. The reaction proceeded through initial Ni-catalyzed C−N bond
  activation, followed by sequential radical addition, redox and proton
  abstraction with cleaved amine moiety in the absence of oxidant, and provides
  an efficient method to prepare various alkyl-substituted oxindoles and
  dihydroquinolinones in good yields.

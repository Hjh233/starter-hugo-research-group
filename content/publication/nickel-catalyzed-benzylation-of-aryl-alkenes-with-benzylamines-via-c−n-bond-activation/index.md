abstract: We have developed the first example of nickel-catalyzed Heck-type
  benzylation of aryl olefins with various benzylamines as benzyl electrophiles,
  and the benzylic C-N bond cleavage was efficiently promoted by the amine-I-2
  charge transfer complex (CT complex). The combination of low-cost NiCl2 and
  I-2 has been found to facilitate Heck reaction of tertiary benzylamines and
  alkenes into various benzyl-substituted alkenes in good to excellent yields.
  This unconventional Heck reaction is proposed to go through initially the
  formation of a benzylic radical via oxidative addition of the C-N bond with
  Ni(0), then capturing by aryl alkene via radical addition, followed by
  single-electron transfer redox and proton abstraction without oxidant and
  external base.

abstract: A nickel-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenative coupling reaction of
  alkane with thiol for the construction of C(spÂ³)-S bond has been established,
  affording more than 50 alkyl thioethers. Notably, pharmaceutical and
  agrochemicals, such as Provigil, Chlorbenside and Pyridaben, were readily
  synthesized by this approach. The sterically hindered ligand BC and disulfide
  which was formed in situ oxidation of thiol, efficiently avoiding
  nickel-catalyst poisoning. A set of mechanistic experiments disclose both
  Ni-catalyzed and Ni-free HAA processes.

abstract: Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling of aminals with N-sulfonyl
  hydrazones has been established via C–N bond activation under base-free
  conditions, in which one C–C bond and one C–S bond were simultaneously
  generated. It was successfully applied in the construction of a variety of
  aminomethyl substituted allylic sulfones. Preliminary mechanistic studies
  indicated that the unique electrophilic cyclopalladated complex was involved
  in the catalytic cycle.

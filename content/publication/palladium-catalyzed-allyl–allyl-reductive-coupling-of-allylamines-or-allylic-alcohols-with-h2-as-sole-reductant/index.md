abstract: Catalytic carbon–carbon bond formation building on reductive coupling
  is a powerful method for the preparation of organic compounds. The
  identification of environmentally benign reductants is key for establishing an
  efficient reductive coupling reaction. Herein an efficient strategy enabling
  H2 as the sole reductant for the palladium-catalyzed allyl–allyl reductive
  coupling reaction is described. A wide range of allylamines and allylic
  alcohols as well as allylic ethers proceed smoothly to deliver the C–C
  coupling products under 1 atm of H2. Kinetic studies suggested that the
  dinuclear palladium species was involved in the catalytic cycle.

abstract: Thanks to the facile imine-enamine tautomerization, the
  β,γ-unsaturated hydrazones have been successfully utilized as surrogates of
  aminodienes for realizing the Pd-catalyzed tandem
  aminomethylamination/aromatization reaction with aminals via C–N bond
  activation. This direct and operationally simple protocol provides a
  fundamentally novel strategy to synthesize aromatic heterocycles from alkenes
  in the absence of external oxidant and base. Mechanistic studies suggested
  that aminal not only functioned as an aminomethyl source but also acted as
  formal oxidant and inner base to promote the aromatization.

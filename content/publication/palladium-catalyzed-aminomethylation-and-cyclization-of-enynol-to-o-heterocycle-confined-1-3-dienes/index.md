abstract: The rational tuning of the electrophilicity of the allylpalladium
  intermediates enables the regioselectively intramolecular 1,2-addition of
  enynol in the presence of aminal. This aminomethylation and cyclization
  reaction via Câ€“N bond activation and intramolecular nucleophilic addition
  provides a rare example for the synthesis of O-containing heterocycle-confined
  1,3-dienes, which is of synthetic potential for further derivatization. The
  method possesses broad substrate generality as well as functional group
  compatibility and efficiently affords a wide range of desired products with
  5-, 6-, and 8-membered O-containing heterocycles with various functional
  groups.

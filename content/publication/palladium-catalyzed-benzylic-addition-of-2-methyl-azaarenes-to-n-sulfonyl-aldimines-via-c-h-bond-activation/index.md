abstract: An efficient protocol for the generation of amines by
  palladium-catalyzed nucleophilic benzylic addition of 2-methyl-substituted
  azaarenes to N-sulfonyl aldimines under neutral conditions via C−H bond
  activation has been developed. This reaction represents a very efficient
  methodology for the synthesis of heterocycle-containing amines and thus opens
  a new way to access amines through C−H bond activation.

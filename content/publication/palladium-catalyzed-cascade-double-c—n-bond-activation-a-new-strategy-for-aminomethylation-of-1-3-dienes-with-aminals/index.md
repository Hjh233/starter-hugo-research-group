abstract: A new palladium-catalyzed selective aminomethylation of conjugated
  1,3-dienes with aminals via double C—N bond activation is described. This
  simple method provides an effective and rapid approach for the synthesis of
  linear α,β-unsaturated allylic amines with perfect regioselectivity.
  Mechanistic studies disclosed that one palladium catalyst cleaved two distinct
  C—N bond to furnish a cascade double C—N bond activation, in which an allylic
  1,3-diamine and allylic 1,2-diamine were initially formed as key intermediates
  through the palladium-catalyzed C—N bond activation of aminal and the
  α,β-unsaturated allylic amine was subsequently produced via
  palladium-catalyzed C—N bond activation of the allylic diamines.

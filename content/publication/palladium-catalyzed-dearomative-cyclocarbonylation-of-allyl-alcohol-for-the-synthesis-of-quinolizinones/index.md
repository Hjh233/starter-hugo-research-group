  An approach for the synthesis of quinolizinone with potential bioactivity has
  been developed via palladium-catalytic dearomative cyclocarbonylation of allyl
  alcohol. Diverse quinolizinone compounds could be attained with good
  efficiencies. A feasible reaction pathway could be a successive procedure of
  allylation, dearomatization, CO insertion and the Heck reaction.

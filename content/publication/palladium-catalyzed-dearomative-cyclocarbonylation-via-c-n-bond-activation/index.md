abstract: A fundamentally novel approach to bioactive quinolizinones is based on
  the palladium-catalyzed intramolecular cyclocarbonylation of allylamines.
  [Pd(Xantphos)I2], which features a very large bite angle, has been found to
  facilitate the rapid carbonylation of azaarene-substituted allylamines into
  bioactive quinolizinones in good to excellent yields. This transformation
  represents the first dearomative carbonylation and is proposed to proceed by
  palladium-catalyzed Cï£¿N bond activation, dearomatization, CO insertion, and a
  Heck reaction.

abstract: >
  A novel palladium-catalyzed aminomethylamination of aminoalkenes with an
  aminal, functioning not only as an aminomethylation reagent but also as an
  oxidant, was developed. This direct and operationally simple protocol provides
  a fundamentally novel and unique approach toward the synthesis of
  2-(2-aminoethyl)indoles and 2-(2-aminoethyl)pyrrolidines, which are important
  building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The unity of this method was
  highlighted by the rapid synthesis of Alosetron, a drug used for the treatment
  of irritable bowel syndrome.

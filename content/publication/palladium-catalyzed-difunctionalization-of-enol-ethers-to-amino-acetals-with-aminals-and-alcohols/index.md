abstract: A new strategy was developed for intercepting the palladium-alkyl
  species generated in Heck reaction via nucleophilic addition prior to the step
  of migratory insertion, which leads to a new palladium-catalyzed
  difunctionalization of enol ethers with aminals and alcohols to afford amino
  acetals. Mechanistic studies suggested that the cationic cyclometalated Pd(II)
  complex generated by the oxidative addition of aminal to a Pd(0) species was
  crucial for this unusual transformation.

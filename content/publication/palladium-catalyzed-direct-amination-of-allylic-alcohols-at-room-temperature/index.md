abstract: A palladium complex ligated with Xantphos has been identified as an
  efficient catalyst for the catalytic amination of allylic alcohols, which
  allows the direct amination of allylic alcohols with amines to proceed at room
  temperature in the absence of additives. The method is compatible with a
  variety of functional groups and can be used to prepare a wide range of linear
  allylic amines in good to excellent yields with high stereoselectivities.

abstract: A new strategy for selective insertion of metal carbenes into C–N bond
  has been developed via Pd-catalyzed C–N bond activation. A series of aminals
  and α-diazoesters with different substituents were successfully incorporated
  even in 0.1 mol % of catalyst under mild conditions, affording a wide range of
  α,β-diamino acid esters with quarternary carbon-centers. Preliminary
  mechanistic studies uncovered that the unique electrophilic cyclopalladated
  species could easily react with diazoacetates to generate a Pd-carbenoid
  intermediate which was involved in the catalytic cycle.

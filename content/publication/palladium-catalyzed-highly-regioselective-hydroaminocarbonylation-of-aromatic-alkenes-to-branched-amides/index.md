abstract: >
  Pd(t-Bu3P)2 has been successfully identified as an efficient catalyst for the
  hydroaminocarbonylation of aromatic alkenes to branched amides under
  relatively mild reaction conditions. With hydroxylamine hydrochloride as an
  additive, both aliphatic and aromatic amines could be used as coupling
  partners for the present reaction, leading to production of branched amides in
  high yields with excellent regioselectivities.

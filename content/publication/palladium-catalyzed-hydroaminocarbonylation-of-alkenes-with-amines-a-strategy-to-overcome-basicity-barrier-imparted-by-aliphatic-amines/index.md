abstract: A novel and efficient palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of
  alkenes with aminals has been developed under mild reaction conditions, and
  allows the synthesis of a wide range of N-alkyl linear amides in good yields
  with high regioselectivity. On the basis of this method, a cooperative
  catalytic system operating by the synergistic combination of palladium,
  paraformaldehyde, and acid was established for promoting the
  hydroaminocarbonylation of alkenes with both aromatic and aliphatic amines,
  which do not react well under conventional palladium-catalyzed
  hydroaminocarbonylation.

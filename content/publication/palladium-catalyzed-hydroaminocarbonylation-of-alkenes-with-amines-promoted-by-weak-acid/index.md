abstract: The weak acid has been identified as an efficient basicity-mask to
  overcome the basicity barrier imparted by aliphatic amines in the Pd-catalyzed
  hydroaminocarbonylation, which enables both aromatic and aliphatic amines to
  be applicable in the palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation reaction.
  Notably, by using this protocol, the marketed herbicide of Propanil and drug
  of Fentanyl could be easily obtained in a one-pot manner.

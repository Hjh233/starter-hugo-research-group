abstract: An efficient strategy for the cleavage of the CN bond of tertiary
  amines was developed with DTBP as an oxidant, in which the cleaved H atom and
  amine moiety were successfully transferred to the desired products. This
  strategy has enabled an efficient palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation
  of alkynes with tertiary amines. Notably, the catalyst loading could be
  lowered from 5 to 0.1 mol %, which represents the lowest catalyst loading
  among the reported work on carbonylation via CN bond activation.

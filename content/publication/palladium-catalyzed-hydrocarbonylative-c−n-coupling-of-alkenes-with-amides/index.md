abstract: An efficient palladium-catalyzed hydrocarbonylative C-N coupling of
  alkenes with amides has been developed. The reaction was performed via
  hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, followed by acyl metathesis with amides. Both
  intermolecular and intramolecular reactions proceed smoothly to give either
  branched or linear amides in high turnover number (3500) with NH4Cl or NMP
  center dot HCl as a proton source under the palladium catalysis. This reaction
  offers a catalytic convenient approach to deuterated amides when inexpensive
  NMP center dot DCl served as a deuterium source.

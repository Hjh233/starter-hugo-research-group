abstract: A palladium-catalyzed intramolecular hydroaminocarbonylation of
  2-vinylbenzylamines in the absence of acidic or any other additives was
  realized via rational designing the catalytic system on the basis of
  mechanistic studies, which allows for the synthesis of a variety of
  six-membered lactams in good to excellent yields with high regioselectivity.
  The postulated palladium-hydride intermediate for initiating the
  hydroaminocarbonylation has been identified and directly used as a catalyst
  for the reaction. Further kinetic studies illustrated that the reaction rate
  is negative first-order-dependent on the substrate concentration with
  palladium hydride as a catalyst.

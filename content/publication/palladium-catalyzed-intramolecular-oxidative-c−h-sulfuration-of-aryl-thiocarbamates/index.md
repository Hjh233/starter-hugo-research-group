abstract: A palladium-catalyzed intramolecular C-H bond sulfuration reaction of
  aryl thiocarbamates has been developed. This strategy provides a new route to
  benzo[d][1,3]oxathiol-2-ones with tolerance of a wide range of substituents.
  Mechanistic studies suggested that the CH activation–sulfuration to afford
  2-imino-1,3-benzoxathiole intermediate might involve an electrophilic
  palladation process.

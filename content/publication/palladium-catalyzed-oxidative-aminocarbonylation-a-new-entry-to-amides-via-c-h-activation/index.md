abstract: A novel palladium-catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation reaction via
  C(sp3)â€“H activation was established, which provides a convenient and general
  method for the construction of arylacetamides via the carbonylation reaction
  of alkyl aromatics and amines. By using this protocol, the marketed drug
  ibuprofen could be easily obtained.

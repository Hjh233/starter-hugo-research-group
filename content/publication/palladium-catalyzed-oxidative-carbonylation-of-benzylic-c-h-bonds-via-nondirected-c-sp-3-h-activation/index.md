abstract: A new strategy for generating benzylpalladium reactive species from
  toluenes via nondirected C(sp3)–H activation has been developed. This led to
  construction of an efficient Pd-catalyzed reaction protocol for the oxidative
  carboxylation of benzylic C–H bonds to form substituted 2-phenylacetic acid
  esters and derivatives from inexpensive, commercially available starting
  materials.

  Palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of alkenes for the synthesis of
  primary amides has long been an elusive aim. Here, we report an efficient
  catalytic system which enables inexpensive NH4Cl to be utilized as a practical
  alternative to gaseous ammonia for the palladium-catalyzed
  alkene-hydroaminocarbonylation reaction. Through appropriate choice of the
  palladium precursors and ligands, either branched or linear primary amides can
  be obtained in good yields with good to excellent regioselectivities. Primary
  mechanistic studies were conducted and disclosed that electrophilic
  acylpalladium species were capable of capturing the NH2-moiety from ammonium
  salts to form amides in the presence of CO with NMP as a base.

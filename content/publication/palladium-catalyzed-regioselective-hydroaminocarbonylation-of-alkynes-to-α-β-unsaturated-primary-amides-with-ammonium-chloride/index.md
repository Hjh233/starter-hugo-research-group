abstract: α,β-Unsaturated primary amides have found numerous applications in
  drug development, organic materials, and polymer sciences. However, the
  catalytic synthesis of α,β-unsaturated primary amides via carbonylation of
  alkynes has long been an elusive endeavor. Here, we report a novel
  palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes with NH4Cl as the amine
  source, enabling the highly chemo- and regioselective synthesis of
  α,β-unsaturated primary amides. A variety of alkynes, including aromatic
  alkynes, aliphatic alkynes, terminal alkynes, internal alkynes, as well as
  diynes with various functional groups, react well. The method turns the
  parasitic noncoordination ability of ammonium salts into a strategic
  advantage, enabling the gram-scale reaction to be performed in the presence of
  0.05 mol % of catalyst with excellent selectivity

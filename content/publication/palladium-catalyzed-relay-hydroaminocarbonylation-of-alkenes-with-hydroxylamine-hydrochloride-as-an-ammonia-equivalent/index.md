abstract: Amides are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials.
  Hydroaminocarbonylation of alkenes has emerged as one of the most direct and
  rapid approaches to amides. Nowadays, these reactions remain largely confined
  to using alkylamines as nitrogen sources, leading to sluggish reactions due to
  their strong binding ability and basicity. Here we show the application of
  abundantly available hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH center dot HCl) as a
  surrogate of ammonia for the relay hydroaminocarbonylation of simple alkenes
  in the presence of a convenient palladium catalyst system. The in situ
  formation of alkylamines from hydroxylamine hydrochloride by
  hydroaminocarbonylation reaction and Lossen rearrangement allows us to
  establish an efficient relay hydroaminocarbonylation. Notably, this
  transformation allows the catalytic formation of two C-N bonds with
  hydroxylamine hydrochloride as an amine source by incorporation of two
  molecules of alkene and avoids the use of alkylamines.

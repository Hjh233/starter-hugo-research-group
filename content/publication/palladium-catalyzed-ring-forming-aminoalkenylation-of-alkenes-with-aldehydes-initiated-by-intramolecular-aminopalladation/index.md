abstract: A palladium‐catalyzed aminopalladation reaction followed by
  nucleophilic addition with aldehydes and dehydration is described. This direct
  and operationally simple procedure provides a rapid and reliable approach to a
  wide range of functionalized tetrahydroisoquinolines with high selectivity.
  Mechanistic studies disclosed that the nucleophilic addition, performed via a
  highly ordered transition‐state, is the turnover‐limiting step in which the
  inherent β‐hydride elimination of the key Csp3−Pd species was controlled by
  the confined conformation and the nucleophilicity of the Csp3−Pd bond was
  enhanced by the strong electron‐donating effect of the nitrogen atom.

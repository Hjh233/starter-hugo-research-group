abstract: The direct C?H benzylation of azoles with benzyl chlorides proceeds
  efficiently, via sequential cleavage of one sp2 C?H bond and two sp3 C?H bonds
  in the presence of a palladium catalyst, to generate a wide range of
  tribenzylated azoles with a quaternary carbon center efficiently. The same
  catalyst could also promote the mono- and di-benzylation reactions through
  fine turning of the base and reaction conditions.

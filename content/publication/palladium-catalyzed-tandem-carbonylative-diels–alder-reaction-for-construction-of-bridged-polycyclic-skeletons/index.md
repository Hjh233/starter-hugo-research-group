abstract: A palladium-catalyzed tandem carbonylative lactonization and
  Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction between aldehyde-tethered benzylhalides and
  alkenes has been developed. A range of alkenes and aldehyde-tethered
  benzylhalides bearing different substituents can be successfully transformed
  into the corresponding bridged polycyclic compounds in good yields. This
  strategy provides a unique approach to complex lactone-containing bridged
  polycyclic compounds.

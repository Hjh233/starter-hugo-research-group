abstract: A novel, highly selective palladium-catalyzed vinylation reaction for
  the direct synthesis of allylic amines from styrenes and aminals has been
  established. The utility of this method was also demonstrated by the rapid
  synthesis of cinnarizine from aldehydes, amines, and simple alkenes in one-pot
  manner. Mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction proceeds through a
  valuable cyclometalated Pd(II) complex generated by the oxidative addition of
  aminal to a Pd(0) species.

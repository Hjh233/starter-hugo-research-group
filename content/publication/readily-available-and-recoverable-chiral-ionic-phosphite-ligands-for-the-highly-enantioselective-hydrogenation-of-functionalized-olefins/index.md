abstract: A series of novel ionic phosphite ligands bearing carbohydrate groups
  were conveniently synthesized and successfully applied in the asymmetric
  hydrogenation of enamides, α-dehydroamino acid esters, and dimethyl itaconate.
  High efficiency and excellent reusability were obtained in an ionic
  liquid–toluene biphasic system.

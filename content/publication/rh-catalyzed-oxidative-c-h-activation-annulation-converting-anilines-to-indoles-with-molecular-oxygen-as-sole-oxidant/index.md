abstract: A practical and efficient Rh(III)-catalyzed aerobic C–H activation has
  been developed for the facile synthesis of a broad range of indoles from
  simple anilines and alkynes. The protocol could be conducted under mild
  conditions and used environmentally friendly oxygen as the sole clear oxidant.

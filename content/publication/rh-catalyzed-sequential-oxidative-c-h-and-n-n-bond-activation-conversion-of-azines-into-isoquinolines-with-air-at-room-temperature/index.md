  A rhodium-catalyzed sequential oxidative C-H annulation reaction between
  ketazines and internal alkynes has been developed via C-H and N-N bond
  activation with air as an external oxidant, which led to an efficient approach
  toward isoquinolines with high atom efficiency at rt. Utilizing the
  distinctive reactivity of this catalysis, both N-atoms of the azines could be
  efficiently incorporated to the desired isoquinolines under very robust and
  mild reaction conditions.

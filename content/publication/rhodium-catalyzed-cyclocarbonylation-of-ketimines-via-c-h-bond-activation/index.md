abstract: A novel rhodium-catalyzed oxidative cyclocarbonylation of ketimines
  via cleavage of two C–H bonds was established, which provided a direct and
  reliable method for the synthesis of a wide range of
  3-methyleneisoindolin-1-ones with mostly moderate yields. Preliminary
  experimental mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that this
  reaction proceeds via imine–enamine tautomerization, N–H cleavage, C–H bond
  activation, CO insertion, and reductive elimination. The mechanism studies
  further ruled out an isolated cyclometalated rhodium complex being involved in
  the present reaction, which was different from many other documented
  rhodium-catalyzed C–H cyclization reactions.

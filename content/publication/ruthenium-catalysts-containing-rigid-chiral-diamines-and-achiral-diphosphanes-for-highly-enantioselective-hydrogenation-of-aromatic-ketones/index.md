abstract: "One chiral element is enough: A new ruthenium catalyst containing a
  rigid chiral diamine (BIDN) and a commercially available inexpensive achiral
  phosphane (DPPF) is highly efficient for the enantioselective hydrogenation of
  ketones (see scheme). High reactivity (S/C up to 100 000) and excellent
  enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee) were obtained."

abstract: A novel silver-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution of aminals with
  ethyl diazoacetate producing β-amino-α-diazoesters has been developed. A
  series of aminals with different amino moieties and substituents were
  successfully incorporated in this reaction, which delivered a wide range of
  β-amino-α-diazocarbonyl compounds in the presence of a lower catalyst loading
  in 2 hours.

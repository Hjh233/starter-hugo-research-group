abstract: >
  The first silver-catalyzed reaction of acetals or ketals with diazoesters
  leading to trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted β-alkoxyacrylates is now
  reported. A broad range of acetals and ketals bearing different substituents
  is compatible with this protocol and thus provides an attractive approach for
  the synthesis of complex β-alkoxyacrylates. The power of this method was
  further demonstrated by the successful synthesis of picoxystrobin, which is
  one of the most popular agricultural fungicides commercialized by Dupont.

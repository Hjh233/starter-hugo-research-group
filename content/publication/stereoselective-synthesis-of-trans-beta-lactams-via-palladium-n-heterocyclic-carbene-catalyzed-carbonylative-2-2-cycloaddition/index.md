abstract: The carbonylative [2+2] cycloaddition of benzyl chlorides and allyl
  derivatives with imines and CO for synthesis of β-lactam is effectively
  catalyzed by palladium/N-heterocyclic carbene complex. The desired β-lactam
  could be obtained in good to excellent yields (61–96%) with excellent
  regioselectivities (trans/cis > 95:5) and chiral lactams could be obtained
  with moderate diastereoselectivities. The KIE experimental studies have
  revealed that the C–H cleavage is most likely to be the rate-limiting step for
  the carbonylative cycloaddition.

abstract: 1,3-Diamines not only are significant motifs in natural products, but
  also serve as building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, unlike
  their 1,2-diamine counterparts, limited efforts have been devoted to the
  development of an effective synthetic approach to 1,3-diamines. In this
  review, the synthetic methods for the preparation of 1,3-diamines are
  summarized.

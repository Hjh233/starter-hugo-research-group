abstract: Transition-metal catalysed C-N bond activation has attracted much
  attention and become one of the most promising bond disconnection and
  formation strategies that encompass a broad spectrum of applications in many
  reactions. In this tutorial review, efficient strategies for catalytic
  cleavage of C(sp)-N, C(sp(2))-N and C(sp(3))-N bonds and their applications in
  new C-C and C-N bond formation reactions are summarized.

abstract: Transition-metal-catalyzed C–H bond functionalization has become one
  of the most promising strategies to prepare complex molecules from simple
  precursors. However, the utilization of environmentally unfriendly oxidants in
  the oxidative C–H bond functionalization reactions reduces their potential
  applications in organic synthesis. This account describes our recent efforts
  in the development of a redox-neutral C–H bond functionalization strategy for
  direct addition of inert C–H bonds to unsaturated double bonds and a
  redox-green C–H bond functionalization strategy for realization of oxidative
  C–H functionalization with O2 as the sole oxidant, aiming to circumvent the
  problems posed by utilizing environmentally unfriendly oxidants. In principle,
  these redox-neutral and redox-green strategies pave the way for establishing
  new environmentally benign transition-metal-catalyzed C–H bond
  functionalization strategies.

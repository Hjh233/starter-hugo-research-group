abstract: A highly chemo- and regioselective 1,4-aminomethylamination of simple
  enynes with aminals to allenic 1,5-diamines by taking advantage of Câ€“N bond
  activation has been reported. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction
  conditions and can be performed under lower catalyst loading (0.1 mol %) with
  high efficiency and broad substrate scope.
